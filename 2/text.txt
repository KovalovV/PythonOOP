Each of us has many such cards in our heads. They can be divided into two categories: maps of what is really, or actual, and maps of what should be, or values. Everything that happens to us in life, we explain on the basis of these mental maps. We are rarely interested in their accuracy; we usually don't even know we have these cards. We simply assume that we see things as they really are, or as they should be.
