Hi Tony,
How are you doing? It’s lovely to have news from you. I’m glad to know that you are finally moving into your brand new apartment. I know you have been waiting a long time for this. And thanks for the invitation, of course we’d like to come. Anyway, I’m pleased to hear you have finally decided to visit the north of Spain, as I suggested you. You’re going to love it!
I think you should rent a holiday apartment and a car; that will give you much more freedom to explore the region at your own pace and convenience. You’ll see that the apartments are quite inexpensive. I’ll send you the details of the house we stayed in when we were there; it was nice and cozy. About the places to visit, you should visit the main mountain and beach towns. I’ll make you a list of the places we went to. I can’t now because I’m at work. And restaurants are easy. Why don’t you check which places have four or five stars on TripAdvisor? The food is always delicious!
Well, I hope this helps. I’m looking forward to visiting you next year. It’ll be great to meet again. Give my regards to Susan
Cheers,
Tom
